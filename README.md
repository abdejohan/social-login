There might be some issues with running this on web if you are using node version >v18.12.  
A workaround has been implemented in this project.  
See this GitHub issue: [Error using Node 19 with expo-cli start --web](https://github.com/expo/expo-cli/issues/4575)
If you intend to run this for web you need to use:

```
yarn run web
```
